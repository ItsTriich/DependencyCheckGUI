# Dependency-Check Graphical User Interface
Dependency-Check GUI is a user friendly interface for the OWASP Dependency-Check CLI tool. Developed with Pythonâ€™s standard modules. This GUI allows developers and security analysts to run vulnerability scans on project dependencies with ease, no command-line gymnastics or third-party libraries.

Dependency-Check is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool that attempts to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within a project's dependencies. It does this by determining if there is a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier for a given dependency. If found, it will generate a report linking to the associated CVE entries.
