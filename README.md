# Dependency-Check Graphical User Interface (Windows)
Dependency-Check GUI is a user friendly interface for the OWASP Dependency-Check CLI tool. Developed with Pythonâ€™s standard modules. This GUI allows developers and security analysts to run vulnerability scans on project dependencies with ease, no command-line gymnastics or third-party libraries.

Dependency-Check is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool that attempts to detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities contained within a project's dependencies. It does this by determining if there is a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifier for a given dependency. If found, it will generate a report linking to the associated CVE entries.

## Notice
This product uses the NVD API but is not endorsed or certified by the NVD.

### NVD API Key Highly Recommended

Dependency-check has moved from using the NVD data-feed to the NVD API.
Users of dependency-check are **highly** encouraged to obtain an NVD API Key; see https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key
Without an NVD API Key dependency-check's updates will be **extremely slow**.
Please see the documentation for the cli integrations on
how to set the NVD API key.
